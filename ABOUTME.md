## Why This Role?

I'm excited about this opportunity because it aligns perfectly with my experience in building production-grade applications and my growing interest in AI/ML integration. 

Having built backend systems at scale for Astrix (event platform with 50+ APIs), I understand the importance of:
- **Clean, maintainable code** that other developers can work with
- **System reliability** and proper error handling
- **Thoughtful AI integration** rather than blind copy-paste

My experience with complex database queries, real-time systems, and API design gives me the foundation to build robust AI-powered tools. I'm particularly drawn to roles where I can combine traditional software engineering with cutting-edge AI capabilities to solve real user problems.

I'm a quick learner who's comfortable with ambiguity and enjoys taking ownership of projects from conception to deployment. I believe in writing code that's not just functional, but maintainable and scalable.
